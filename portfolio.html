        <p class="portfolio-circle first"> <br> Theramin Project</p>
        <p class="portfolio-square first">For this project, I worked on a team to 
            create a working theramin. We did research, bought parts, assembled, and
            programmed the theramin. We also programmed a start-up sound to be
            "Hullabaloo, Caneck! Caneck!" from the Aggie War Hymn.

        <p class="portfolio-circle second"><br>LED Project</p>
        <p class="portfolio-square second">The LED project was a competition between teams
            to make the "coolest" project involving LEDs. My team soldered and attatched a grid of 
            of LEDs to a ceilinf tile and prgrammed images for the LED grid.

        <p class="portfolio-circle third"><br>Robotic Arm Project</p>
        <p class="portfolio-square third">During the robotic arm project, I was
            a member of the sub-team who focused on designing the hand of the 
            robotic arm. We designed and 3D-printed a hand that could be opened 
            and closed with servos.
